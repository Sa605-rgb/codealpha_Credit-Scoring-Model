# codealpha_Credit-Scoring-Model
This project involves building a machine learning-based credit scoring model that predicts the creditworthiness of individuals using historical financial data. The model uses classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest to determine whether a person is likely to default on a loan or make timely payments.
