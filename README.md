# 💳 Credit Scoring Model

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the **creditworthiness** of individuals based on historical financial data. The objective is to help financial institutions evaluate loan applicants by identifying credit risk using classification algorithms.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The model classifies whether an individual is likely to:
- **Repay** the credit on time (Good Credit)
- **Default** on the credit (Bad Credit)

This is achieved by training classification models on a labeled dataset of past borrowers.
